# Analog-Digital-Converter-Board-for-ECG-Application
This project involves the development of an analog-digital converter (ADC) board designed for ECG (electrocardiogram) applications using KiCad. The board interfaces with an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, which is programmed to handle data transmission to a data sink.
