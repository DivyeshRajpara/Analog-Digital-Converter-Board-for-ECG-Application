# Analog-Digital-Converter-Board-for-ECG-Application
This project involves the development of an analog-digital converter (ADC) board designed for ECG (electrocardiogram) applications using KiCad. The board interfaces with an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, which is programmed to handle data transmission to a data sink.

components
Circuit board: Schematics and PCB layout files for the ADC board.
ESP32-S3 Firmware: Code for configuring and managing data transmission from the ESP32-S3 microcontroller.
Documentation: Detailed instructions for assembling the hardware and setting up the software environment.

features
ECG Signal Acquisition: Accurate acquisition of ECG signals through the designed ADC board.
KiCAD Design: Complete PCB design using KiCad, including schematics and layout.
ESP32-S3 Integration: Programming of ESP32-S3 for efficient data processing and transmission.
Wireless Data Transmission: Real-time transmission of ECG data to a remote data sink for analysis and storage.
